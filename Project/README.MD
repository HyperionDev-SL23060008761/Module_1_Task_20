## New Saved for Later Page

## Better and Newer Like System (Ratings)

- **More Options for Initial Ratings**

  - Our Rating System allows you to choose between 3 different color codes when adding an Anime to your list to help you better understand the animes you added in the past (instead of liking or not liking)

- **More Categories**

  - If you marked your Anime as Watched, you are able to go to the Ratings page and it will appear there (Will only show up if you watched the Anime). Once there you have access to 7 Major Rating Categories that can have a rating range from 0 - 10 to accurately reflect what you thought after watching a specific Anime.
